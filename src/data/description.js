  ' TEFL Assistant is a collection of simple games and tools to assist "Teachers of English as a Foreign Language". It is largely based on my preferences, but as this site grows, there will be opportunity for people to submit their own materials to share with others. This site is made for desktop and large screen tablets intended for use in the classroom.';
